            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Dashi (出汁, だし) is a family of stocks used in Japanese cuisine. Dashi forms the base for miso soup, clear broth soup, noodle broth soup, and many simmering liquids to accentuate the savory flavor known as umami. Dashi is also mixed into the flour base of some grilled foods like okonomiyaki and takoyaki.</p>
            <p>Shiitake dashi is made by soaking dried shiitake mushrooms in water. Dried shiitake is preferred over fresh due to a stronger presence of savory or umami flavors.</p>

              <li>Allow the dashi to cool, and then strain to remove any solids. The resulting dashi stock can be stored in the refrigerator or used immediately.</li>
