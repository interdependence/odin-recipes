    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dashi (出汁, だし) is a family of stocks used in Japanese cuisine. Dashi forms the base for miso soup, clear broth soup, noodle broth soup, and many simmering liquids to accentuate the savory flavor known as umami. Dashi is also mixed into the flour base of some grilled foods like okonomiyaki and takoyaki.</p>
    <p>Kombu dashi is made by soaking or gently simmering kelp in water; soaking is traditional & fit for making baby food while simmering is a more modern practice. Kombu dashi becomes bitter & unpalatable when boiled.</p>
